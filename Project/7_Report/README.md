# Description
*  Biometric fingerprint devices are used in electronic balloters to identify voters. It is a fingerprint-based voting device that does not require the user to carry an ID card, including the required ID card. People in the polling booth can capture the fingerprints of voters in the field by simply placing their finger on the device. This acts as an ID.
 This data is  passed to the control unit for  checks. Controller  retrieves data from the reader and compares this  data with  existing data stored in during voter registration. If the data matches previously stored information Of the registered fingerprints, that person can cast  votes. Otherwise, a warning message will be displayed on the LCD and  votes will be prohibited. Voting is run manually using the push button. LCD is used to display results of related messages, warnings, and  results.

 # 4 W's & 1 H
 
 * Who : Anyone who is eligible to vote

* Why: As we know vote is everybody's right to vote.

* When : At the time of Elections.

* Where: Either  at a place or from our own place

* How : By just placing our finger on the screen.
# High Level Requirements

|ID |	Description|
|-------|-----------------------------------------|
|HR01|It should be able to take input from the user|
|HR02|It should detect any finger print|
|HR03|It should be able to do functions like Enroll, Detect, Increment and Decrement finger-print data.|


# Low Level Requirements

|ID |	Description|
|---------|---------------------------------|
|LR01|User has to Enroll |
|LR02|User has to know the usage|
|LR03|Use can decrement or increment the data||
|LR04|User may download the attendance data |

# Applications

*  It can be used in small elections such as: Fast track voting.
 
 * Can be used to conduct  polls at the Annual Meeting.

LCD Driver (Actuator):

    An LCD driver is a semiconductor chip used to power and control a liquid crystal display (LCD). The LCD driver or LCD controller also provides interfaces for various LCD components. There are many types of LCD drivers. The LCD monitor driver tells the operating system "OS" about the supported screen resolutions. The LCD display driver uses multi-line addressing LCD technology to provide high resolution color displays and high speed video.
    The Pneumatic Super Twisted LCD Driver (STN) provides excellent resolution for many colors and provides a high contrast display with a wide viewing angle. TFT drivers (thin film transistors) can provide very high resolution. Thin-film transistor (TFT) LCDs have transistors embedded in the panel. This improves image stability and reduces pixel-to-pixel crosstalk. Dedicated and dedicated LCD drivers are also available.

Crystal Oscillator(Sensor):

    A crystal oscillator is an electronic oscillator that uses a crystal as a frequency selection factor to achieve the inverse piezoelectric effect. The mechanical resonance of the vibrating crystal with piezoelectric characteristics is used to acquire an electric signal with a high precision frequency. Crystal oscillators are considered superior to ceramic resonators because of their high stability, high quality, low cost, and small size.

Finger print Module(Sensor):

    The fingerprint sensor module is used to verify your identity. Widely used in computers, mobile phones, electronic door locks, access control systems, security safes, etc. This ultra-thin optical fingerprint sensor module is designed and manufactured by Jingy Technology. we can store and identify up to 3000 fingerprints.
    It emits light using a LED, which passes through a specially designed plate and illuminates the finger across the plate. The internal image sensor receives scattered light from your finger and emits an electrical signal.
