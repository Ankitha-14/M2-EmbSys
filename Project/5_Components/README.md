# Arm Controller
* The ARM controller is the brain of this project. The small LQFP64-package has the functionality of a 32-bit ARM7TDMIS microcontroller. 8 kB to 40 kB on-chip static RAM and 32 kB to 
 512 kB on-chip flash memory. The 128-bit wide  interface / accelerator enables high speed operation at 60MHz. These are created by 45 high-speed GPIO lines with various 32-bit timers, single or dual 10-bit ADCs, 10-bit DACs, PWM channels, and  up to 9 edges or level-sensitive external interrupt pins on the. Will be done. A microcontroller suitable for industrial control and medical systems.
