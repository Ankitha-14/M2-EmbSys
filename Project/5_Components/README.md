# Arm Controller
* The ARM controller is the brain of this project. The small LQFP64-package has the functionality of a 32-bit ARM7TDMIS microcontroller. 8 kB to 40 kB on-chip static RAM and 32 kB to 
 512 kB on-chip flash memory. The 128-bit wide  interface / accelerator enables high speed operation at 60MHz. These are created by 45 high-speed GPIO lines with various 32-bit timers, single or dual 10-bit ADCs, 10-bit DACs, PWM channels, and  up to 9 edges or level-sensitive external interrupt pins on the. Will be done. A microcontroller suitable for industrial control and medical systems.

# MAX - 232
* The MAX232 is an integrated circuit that converts a signal from an RS232 serial interface into a signal suitable for use in TTL compatible digital logic circuits. The MAX232 are dual 
 drivers / receivers that typically convert RX, TX, CTS, and RTS signals. The driver provides RS232 voltage level output (approximately Â± 7.5V) from a single + 5V power supply via an on-chip charge pump and an external capacitor.
 
 # Fingerprint Module
 * This device is the most popular of all identification  devices because it is easy to retrieve and many sources of  are available for  data collection. It turned out to be widely used for law enforcement and immigration purposes. The module used here is R305. The basis of this identification process  comes from the "Galton Point". This is a specific feature defined by Sir Francis Garton who can identify the fingerprint  This  module compares the scanned image  with an  existing fingerprint to get  the correct ID. The comparison is made by the 
 processor and the comparison is made between the valley and the  edge. The entire fingerprint is recorded, but the computer  takes only part of the print for comparison with other records.
 # Crystal Oscillator
 
 
 # Power source module
 * The main blocks of power  are under the  transformer, rectifier, filter and 7805 voltage regulator. These provide  regulated power  to devices that are first converted to 12VAC. 12V  AC is converted to DC using a rectifier circuit. Finally, the 7805 voltage regulator provides a constant 5VDC power supply  to the circuit.

#  keyboard 
*  Push buttons are used on the keypad. Pushbuttons, or just buttons, are a simple switching mechanism for controlling the aspects of a machine or  process. Buttons are usually made of 
  hard material, usually plastic or metal. 

#  reset 
*  This button is used to reset the entire system and can  be configured for the next  dials.
