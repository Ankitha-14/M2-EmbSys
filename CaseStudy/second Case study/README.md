* Fingerprint Module:

Because of its ease of acquisition and the quantity of data collecting sources available, the device is the most popular of all the identifying devices. It has a wide range of applications in law enforcement and immigration. R305 is the module in question. The scanned image is compared to an earlier existing finger print of yours in this module to determine your true identity. The processor performs the comparison, which is conducted between the valleys and ridges. Despite the fact that your entire fingerprint is recorded, the computer simply compares bits of it to other records. 
* Crystal Oscillator:

An electronic oscillator is a circuit that generates a periodic electrical signal, usually a sine or square wave.
The intrinsic clock frequency of the ARM controller is 4 Mhz.
To boost system performance, we're using a 60 Mhz clock frequency as an external source.
