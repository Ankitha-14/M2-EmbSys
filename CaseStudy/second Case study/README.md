* Fingerprint Module:

Because of its ease of acquisition and the quantity of data collecting sources available, the device is the most popular of all the identifying devices. It has a wide range of applications in law enforcement and immigration. R305 is the module in question. The scanned image is compared to an earlier existing finger print of yours in this module to determine your true identity. The processor performs the comparison, which is conducted between the valleys and ridges. Despite the fact that your entire fingerprint is recorded, the computer simply compares bits of it to other records. 
* Crystal Oscillator:

An electronic oscillator is a circuit that generates a periodic electrical signal, usually a sine or square wave.
The intrinsic clock frequency of the ARM controller is 4 Mhz.
To boost system performance, we're using a 60 Mhz clock frequency as an external source. 

* Power Source Model:

Transformer, Rectifier, Filter, and 7805 voltage regulator are the major components of a power supply. These will give the unit with a regulated power source after it has been converted to 12V AC. A rectifier circuit is used to convert 12V AC to DC. Finally, the 7805 voltage regulator supplies a steady 5V DC supply to the circuit. 

* Arm Controller:

ARM controller is Brain of this project, it has the capabilities  like 32-bit ARM7TDMI-S microcontroller in a tiny LQFP64  package.eight kB to forty kB of on-chip static RAM and 32 kB to 512kB of on-chip flash memory. 128-bit huge  interface/accelerator allows high-velocity 60 MHz operation.  Various 32-bit timers, unmarried or twin 10-bit ADC(s), 10-bit  DAC, PWM channels and forty five rapid GPIO traces with as much as 9  area or stage touchy outside interrupt pins make those  microcontrollers appropriate for business manipulate and clinical systems.

* MAX-232:

The MAX-232 is an incorporated circuit that converts alerts from an RS-232 serial port to alerts appropriate to be used in TTL  like minded virtual common sense circuits. The MAX-232 is a twin  driver/receiver and commonly converts the RX, TX, CTS and  RTS alerts .The drivers offer RS-232 voltage degree outputs  (approx. ± 7.five V) from a single + five V deliver through on-chip  price pumps and outside capacitors

* Keypad:

Push buttons are utilized in keypad. A push-button or clearly  button is a easy transfer mechanism for controlling a few  factor of a system or a process. Buttons are usually made 
 out of tough material, generally plastic or metal.
 
 # Requirements
 
 • Less manpower required.
 
• Time conscious, much less time required for vote casting & 
 counting.
 
• Avoids invalid vote casting because it prevents unregistered 
 citizens from vote casting.
 
• Ease of transportation because of its compact size.

• Convenient at the a part of vote.
